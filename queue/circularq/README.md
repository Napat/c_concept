Circular Queue , also called ‘Ring Buffer’, is a linear data structure in which 
the operations are performed based on First In First Out(FIFO) principle. 
The last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.  
  
There are both API that insert elements until queue becomes full then can not insert the next element 
even if there is a space in front of queue and another will automatic replace old element, 
you do so at your own risk.
